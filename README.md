## Project Steps
### Step 1: Exploratory Data Analysis
- Conducted Analysis of the dataset to understand the distributions, correlations and characteristics of the data.
- Visualized relationships between features and the target variable using various plots to gain deeper insights.
### Step 2: Model Building
- Evaluated various machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, SVM, KNN, and Voting Classifier.
- Each model has achieved 100% accuracy and Naive Bayes achieved 98.84% accuracy.
### Step 3: Model Evaluation
- Evaluated machine learning model performance using accuracy, and confusion matrix
### Step 4: Deployment
- Selected Naive Bayes model for the deployment to predict the target variable as it achieved 98.84% accuracy.
